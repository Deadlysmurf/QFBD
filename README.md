# Deadlysmurf Data Blog Project
I'm going to try blogging the random, sometimes silly data questions I try to answer. It's good practice.

## Questions for the Baseball Database (QFBD)
This is going to be a theme for a while, small questions that I get asked (or ask myself) during the baseball season. I'm going to include the .py files in the src file for this project.

Eventually I will remember to write the code for requirements.txt so that it's easy to run the code to test/tweek/play with it. But not today.

Acknowledgments to the [pybaseball project](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball) for making pulling the data delightfully simple. 

## Theme
The theme for this website is [Libretto - Jekyll Theme](https://github.com/ferrolho/jekyll-theme-libretto) by [Henrique Ferrolho](https://github.com/ferrolho)
